Indexer Notes

---[Regarding Stemming]---
If one attempts to search for 'Transformers' and 'Transformer' on Google, the former word yields in first document being the Wikipedia document of the Transformers franchise, but the latter word, yields the first document being the Wikipedia document of the electric transformer. Notice, the search was not phrase searching, it was just normal search, for after all no double quotations were used.

   The experiment disproves that...
	- ...Google returns any documents with the stemmed form of the word, because searching for 'Transformers' does not yeild the electirc transformer as the first document of the search, which is the case when searching for 'Transformer' without the plural 's'. 
	- ...Google returns documents with the stememd form or the original form of the word because searching for 'Transformers' does not yield the Wikipedia document of the electric transformer at all (checked first two pages), despite its importance and ranking.

Therefore, it is the case that Google does not stem the word at all, and thus stemming has been removed in version 2 of the indexer.

One might then wonder what is the difference between phrase searching and normal searching? The difference would be in the position of the words in the search, but not in their form.
